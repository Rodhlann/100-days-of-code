# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8 March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mostly just ended up drawing up my mockups for how I would like the final UI to work. Sort of got stuck in a loop of not knowing how to implement some functionality that boiled down to me not really having a vision for the UI, but I think that's been resolved. Did a little work to start gearing the backend for communication with the front. 

**Thoughts:**: Really came to a strong conclusion today that I have no idea how to build UI apps that are enjoyable to use and look at. That sort of sparked a need to go and draw out the application as I want it to be. I think that this will at least put me on track to make something I'm happy with. A friend of mine suggested a few libraries for helping with building UIs, which I might look in to. I feel like those are sort of cheating, when it comes down to it, because they take care of the layer of CSS skills that I've been avoiding. One of them, *Material.js*, seems pretty cool though, because it has a gallery functionality that allows you to track your iterations on the UI and easily get feedback from people about that. The feedback concept is something that I really like. I think I definitely have the ability to be a great designer for web apps, I just don't have the knowledge or context to get there at the moment.

### Day 7: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Split the growing UI application up into several components and gave the user the ability to add new todos.

**Thoughts:**: I still really hate CSS, but I'm hoping I can get some input from friends on how to design the app better. It's in a good working state, but I'd like it to be attractive to the eye and easy to use. Angular is kind of growing on me. I still feel like it's a little heavy, in that I could have done all of this in half the time with React, but it's not terrible. I'm sure I will come to find it's nice nuances as I continue to dig into the functionality.

### Day 6: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the UI app. Added a User model and service and began shaping the application styles up a little differently. 

**Thoughts:**: Decided I sort of want this to be a mobile app. Or at least mobile ready. Ended up messing with CSS FOREVER which was pretty frustrating. Really hoping there's a way to get a grasp on that language to a point where I feel like I know what I'm doing. Otherwise I'm happy with where the UI app is for now. I think it's time to start working on the back end again. At the very least I think I should do that just to avoid burning out on the Angular, or more specifically CSS.

### Day 5: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and put together the base REST calls for the server. Still need to set up the server side endpoints, but I'm having a lot more fun doing the UI right now, so I'm going to continue with that until I feel I can't get any further without live data. Haven't tested the endpoints yet, but I'm fairly certain they won't work in their current state. 

**Thoughts:**: Not really sure how I feel about the rxJs/Http service setup that Angular uses. I really just wish it was as simple as axios or fetch from React. I have heard great things about rxJs in the past, but I'm not really seeing the benefit of it so far. On a more high level note, I really need to be better about restricting the time I'm taking to code per day. I'm really feeling myself potentially beginning to burn out, and want to make sure I can continue coding for the entirety of my 100 day stretch. Definitely need to stop staying up so late to code!!!

### Day 4: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Really began digging into the Angular functionality that I will need for this project. Got a good active/complete workflow and the todo editing experience is pretty solid.

**Thoughts:**: I'm still not sure I'm sold on Angular yet. It's way better than AngularJs so far, but I just really wish it was as straighforward as React. I'll have to see how I feel once I've integrated live data. As for the app itself, the general workflow is nice and I'm happy with it, but I really want to make something visually appealing, and I just don't know how to go about doing that right now. Really going to have to start researching other TODO apps to see what styles/workflows are interesting and attractive.

### Day 2: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began setting up the database for my project. Created matching models and did quite a bit of research in to connecting the two. 

**Thoughts:**: I've never done very much database work, especially in C#. And the majority of that has been set up by other people. Digging in to this has been a pretty big hurdle, especially since there seems to be so many different ways to set up a DB with C#. I think using the standard MS SQL Server/SSMS combo is pretty much the way to go because of this. I'm hoping that creating the entity layer is simple enough so I can quickly start building out my controllers. I probably won't create a service layer for such a small project, though I know that from a best practices perspective that's probably the way to go. Tomorrow I would really like to get at least one postman call through to add a new user. That's gonna be the goal.

### Day 1: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a new C# project and began following a tutorial to figure out how to put together an API in .NET Core. 

**Thoughts:**: .NET has a lot of magic going on that isn't super well documented. Might just be me overthinking it, but it's just weird. Now that I've got the API figured out I will probably set up the standard workflow for adding new users/todos with postman before going through the steps of building out the actual UI app.
