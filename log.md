# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 18, 2018

**Thoughts:**: .NET has a lot of magic going on that isn't super well documented. Might just be me overthinking it, but it's just weird. Now that I've got the API figured out I will probably set up the standard workflow for adding new users/todos with postman before going through the steps of building out the actual UI app. 

**Link to work:**: TODO...
