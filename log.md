# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14-15 March 31-April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the last two days troubleshooting the Sql Server connection to my application. After quite a bit of poking and research I finally got data all the way from the DB to the front end! Very exciting. Next I will be creating methods to add/update/delete todos. After that I will be adding the User functionality, which will pretty much close up all the MVP work I need to do for the project!

**Thoughts:**: I think the most frustrating thing so far about using C#/.NET is the sheer amount of information there is for the platform. There is just way to much. And it seems that things change/update so frequently that there's a million outdated/deprecated ways to do something wrong, but only a few ways to do it right in the current version of .NET. This creates an extremely frustrating development experience. When it works, it works, though, and at the end of the day that's really all I can hope for. Really happy with how far I've come on this project, and I'm sure that the things I have learned so far will help me a lot at my new job!

### Day 13 March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the backend and frontend talking! After some CORS issues figured out everything is working as expected. Very excited! 

**Thoughts:**: Just happy to get everything talking now :) Can't wait to move forward with the rest of the functionality

### Day 12 March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Talked more about CSS and learned a few things about UX. Trying to make the app usable, but trying to also strike a balance for what I think looks good, since I'm really gonna be the only user. Also picked up my functional programming book for a bit. 

**Thoughts:**: Eventually I need to work on the backend. Sort of getting burnt out on the front end work. I really want to finish this project up soon so I can start digging back into my functional programming learning. I think that's the direction I really want to go in my learning for a bit.

### Day 11 March 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completely built out the category workflow in the UI. The user can now add/select categories and see the filtered values on the main page. Also added my first CSS animation! 

**Thoughts:**: I'm getting more in the flow of the Angular process now, which is nice. The interesting thing about that, though, is that I feel that my experience with React has actually made me a better Angular developer. I did quite a bit with Angularjs for a previous project at work, and I can just cringe at all the terrible code I wrote, but now I feel that my workflow and understanding of how front end applications should behave is much better. I give that credit to react/redux. I'm also feeling much more comfortable with CSS now. I'm still sort of frustrated by it, but I think that I have the fundamentals of how it SHOULD work down, which will hopefully help me as I move forward.

### Day 10 March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the entire time just looking up CSS animation information

**Thoughts:**: I'd really like to add more CSS animations to the application. I feel like they make an application feel more modern, but I want to be able to add them without disturbing the user workflow! I guess I'll just have to tinker.

### Day 9 March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sat down with a friend today to talk about CSS and how to fix the crap I'd been writing. I think I learned a lot and was able to use my new knowledge to create a UI I'm much more comfortable with. Today was 100% UI/CSS refactoring. 

**Thoughts:**: CSS is annoying, but knowing that I can do a CSS reset is super useful. Having to work around someone else's styles just makes everything way more frustrating. I'm really excited about the new direction the UI is taking and I can't wait to implement the rest of it in the same style.

### Day 8 March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Mostly just ended up drawing up my mockups for how I would like the final UI to work. Sort of got stuck in a loop of not knowing how to implement some functionality that boiled down to me not really having a vision for the UI, but I think that's been resolved. Did a little work to start gearing the backend for communication with the front. 

**Thoughts:**: Really came to a strong conclusion today that I have no idea how to build UI apps that are enjoyable to use and look at. That sort of sparked a need to go and draw out the application as I want it to be. I think that this will at least put me on track to make something I'm happy with. A friend of mine suggested a few libraries for helping with building UIs, which I might look in to. I feel like those are sort of cheating, when it comes down to it, because they take care of the layer of CSS skills that I've been avoiding. One of them, *Material.js*, seems pretty cool though, because it has a gallery functionality that allows you to track your iterations on the UI and easily get feedback from people about that. The feedback concept is something that I really like. I think I definitely have the ability to be a great designer for web apps, I just don't have the knowledge or context to get there at the moment.

### Day 7: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Split the growing UI application up into several components and gave the user the ability to add new todos.

**Thoughts:**: I still really hate CSS, but I'm hoping I can get some input from friends on how to design the app better. It's in a good working state, but I'd like it to be attractive to the eye and easy to use. Angular is kind of growing on me. I still feel like it's a little heavy, in that I could have done all of this in half the time with React, but it's not terrible. I'm sure I will come to find it's nice nuances as I continue to dig into the functionality.

### Day 6: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the UI app. Added a User model and service and began shaping the application styles up a little differently. 

**Thoughts:**: Decided I sort of want this to be a mobile app. Or at least mobile ready. Ended up messing with CSS FOREVER which was pretty frustrating. Really hoping there's a way to get a grasp on that language to a point where I feel like I know what I'm doing. Otherwise I'm happy with where the UI app is for now. I think it's time to start working on the back end again. At the very least I think I should do that just to avoid burning out on the Angular, or more specifically CSS.

### Day 5: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went ahead and put together the base REST calls for the server. Still need to set up the server side endpoints, but I'm having a lot more fun doing the UI right now, so I'm going to continue with that until I feel I can't get any further without live data. Haven't tested the endpoints yet, but I'm fairly certain they won't work in their current state. 

**Thoughts:**: Not really sure how I feel about the rxJs/Http service setup that Angular uses. I really just wish it was as simple as axios or fetch from React. I have heard great things about rxJs in the past, but I'm not really seeing the benefit of it so far. On a more high level note, I really need to be better about restricting the time I'm taking to code per day. I'm really feeling myself potentially beginning to burn out, and want to make sure I can continue coding for the entirety of my 100 day stretch. Definitely need to stop staying up so late to code!!!

### Day 4: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Really began digging into the Angular functionality that I will need for this project. Got a good active/complete workflow and the todo editing experience is pretty solid.

**Thoughts:**: I'm still not sure I'm sold on Angular yet. It's way better than AngularJs so far, but I just really wish it was as straighforward as React. I'll have to see how I feel once I've integrated live data. As for the app itself, the general workflow is nice and I'm happy with it, but I really want to make something visually appealing, and I just don't know how to go about doing that right now. Really going to have to start researching other TODO apps to see what styles/workflows are interesting and attractive.

### Day 2: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began setting up the database for my project. Created matching models and did quite a bit of research in to connecting the two. 

**Thoughts:**: I've never done very much database work, especially in C#. And the majority of that has been set up by other people. Digging in to this has been a pretty big hurdle, especially since there seems to be so many different ways to set up a DB with C#. I think using the standard MS SQL Server/SSMS combo is pretty much the way to go because of this. I'm hoping that creating the entity layer is simple enough so I can quickly start building out my controllers. I probably won't create a service layer for such a small project, though I know that from a best practices perspective that's probably the way to go. Tomorrow I would really like to get at least one postman call through to add a new user. That's gonna be the goal.

### Day 1: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a new C# project and began following a tutorial to figure out how to put together an API in .NET Core. 

**Thoughts:**: .NET has a lot of magic going on that isn't super well documented. Might just be me overthinking it, but it's just weird. Now that I've got the API figured out I will probably set up the standard workflow for adding new users/todos with postman before going through the steps of building out the actual UI app.
