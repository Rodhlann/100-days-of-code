# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Really began digging into the Angular functionality that I will need for this project. Got a good active/complete workflow and the todo editing experience is pretty solid.

**Thoughts:**: I'm still not sure I'm sold on Angular yet. It's way better than AngularJs so far, but I just really wish it was as straighforward as React. I'll have to see how I feel once I've integrated live data. As for the app itself, the general workflow is nice and I'm happy with it, but I really want to make something visually appealing, and I just don't know how to go about doing that right now. Really going to have to start researching other TODO apps to see what styles/workflows are interesting and attractive.

### Day 1: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began setting up the database for my project. Created matching models and did quite a bit of research in to connecting the two. 

**Thoughts:**: I've never done very much database work, especially in C#. And the majority of that has been set up by other people. Digging in to this has been a pretty big hurdle, especially since there seems to be so many different ways to set up a DB with C#. I think using the standard MS SQL Server/SSMS combo is pretty much the way to go because of this. I'm hoping that creating the entity layer is simple enough so I can quickly start building out my controllers. I probably won't create a service layer for such a small project, though I know that from a best practices perspective that's probably the way to go. Tomorrow I would really like to get at least one postman call through to add a new user. That's gonna be the goal.

### Day 0: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a new C# project and began following a tutorial to figure out how to put together an API in .NET Core. 

**Thoughts:**: .NET has a lot of magic going on that isn't super well documented. Might just be me overthinking it, but it's just weird. Now that I've got the API figured out I will probably set up the standard workflow for adding new users/todos with postman before going through the steps of building out the actual UI app.
