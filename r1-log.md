The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 18, 2018.

## Log

### R1D4
Worked to improve the Angular frontend and get it pushed up to github. Got a pretty nice workflow now, with working active/complete statuses and a user friendly editing workflow for the todos. 

### R1D3
Unable to access PC with C# dev environment so I decided to start working on the Angular frontend. Got a basic todo set up and spent a lot of time messing with CSS.

### R1D2
Spent quite a bit of time studying up on C# and databases. Got something simple set up. We will see how that goes. Tomorrow the plan is to set up the controller layer and start passing in calls. 

### R1D1 
Going to begin working on my C#/Angular2 Todo list app. I plan to have a relational database on the back as well, with user auth capabilities. I would also like to start learning some less/sass when I make it to the front end, but that's for another day...
