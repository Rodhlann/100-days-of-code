### R1D2
Spent quite a bit of time studying up on C# and databases. Got something simple set up. We will see how that goes. Tomorrow the plan is to set up the controller layer and start passing in calls. 

### R1D1 
Going to begin working on my C#/Angular2 Todo list app. I plan to have a relational database on the back as well, with user auth capabilities. I would also like to start learning some less/sass when I make it to the front end, but that's for another day...
